<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Tobías Nuñez Allende, I’m 26 years old and currently in my 4th year of a Systems Engineering degree. I live in Córdoba, Argentina, and I’m passionate about building practical, efficient solutions through technology and hands-on experience.</p>

<p>Together with my girlfriend, I manage Cabañas Pasión Serrana, a cabin rental business located in Las Calles, Córdoba. I’m currently developing a desktop application to manage reservations, expenses, and income for the cabins, including remote access via a web interface.</p>

<p>In the past, I worked as a cashier at my family’s local store, where I handled orders and managed transaction records using Excel.</p>

<p>I have experience using Python and SQL, and I’m currently learning C. My main areas of interest include databases, communications, and data intelligence. I prefer working remotely, which allows me to balance my technical work with business management.</p>

<p>I’m also learning digital photography, focusing on portraits, landscapes, and product photography. I shoot with a Sony A6400 and edit using Lightroom Mobile.</p>

<p>I’m a curious and creative person, always looking for new ways to solve problems. I enjoy listening, collaborating, and contributing meaningfully to any team I’m part of.</p>
